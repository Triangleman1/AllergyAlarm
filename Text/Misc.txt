Just found out you can do:
git add */views.py rather than typing out folders

HEAD - pointer to a specific commit, I think it's user specific. 
main - default name for default branch
origin/main - remote copy of main 

My HEAD got detached from any branches. Fixed with: 
git checkout <branch-name>


Mistakes/Bugs:
Was looking at Csharp code for datetimes rather than python
Forgot about __gte=
