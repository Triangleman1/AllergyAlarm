Just found out you can do:
git add */views.py rather than typing out folders

HEAD - pointer to a specific commit, I think it's user specific. 
main - default name for default branch
origin/main - remote copy of main 

My HEAD got detached from any branches. Fixed with: 
git checkout <branch-name>

To convert date times into custom readable formats:
[point.datetime.strftime("%B %d, %I:%M%p") for point in data]


Mistakes/Bugs:
Was looking at Csharp code for datetimes rather than python
Forgot about __gte= 
Django settings automatically added a default time zone in tables
Any python file I write and run that uses django files needs to run a set up function beforehand
The x-axis values for chart.js need to be strings but the y-axis don't???
Default chart.js x-axis type is category - why everything is evenly spaced
I needed to install a driver - didn't know javascript gave its error messages in the inspect menu
