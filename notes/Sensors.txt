Zero-rate level - the actual output signal if there is no angular rate present.



Gyroscope: I3G4250D
Digital
Positive for counterclockwise
Angular Data: (register address)
OUT_X_L (0x28), OUT_X_H (0x29)
OUT_Y_L (0x2A), OUT_Y_H (0x2B)
OUT_Z_L (0x2C), OUT_Z_H (0x2D)
All use two's Complement

Based on accelerometer, X_L and X_H combine to form full X

Modes:
Bypass (one stored at a time)
FIFO   (Once full, buffer stops taking in input)
Stream (continuously stored, oldest get erased when buffer fills)




Heart Rate: MAX30001
ECG:
ECG samples are recorded in 18-bit, left justified two’s compliment format. After converting to signed magnitude 
format, the ECG input voltage is calculated by the following equation:

VECG (mV) = ADC x VREF / (2^17 x ECG_GAIN)

ADC is the ADC counts in signed magnitude format
VREF is 1000mV (typ) (refer to the Electrical Characteristics section)
ECG_GAIN is 20V/V, 40V/V, 80V/V, or 160V/V, set in CNFG_ECG (0x15)

Pace Detection:
Real time monitoring of pace edge events can be accomplished by unmasking PEDGE via EN_INT (0x02) and 
EN_INT2 (0x03) and using the self-clear behavior; see CLR_PEDGE=1 in register MNGR_INT (0x04).

A single-ended analog signal is provided at pin AOUT to allow digitization of the PACE pulses with an 
external analog to digital converter. See register CNFG_PACE (0x1A) for gain, low pass and high pass filter 
options and AOUT signal selection.

BioZ:
20-bit, left justified two’s compliment format. After converting to signed magnitude format, BioZ is 
calculated by the following equation:

BioZ (Ω) = ADC x VREF / (2^19 x BIOZ_CGMAG x BIOZ_GAIN)

ADC is the ADC counts in signed magnitude format, VREF is 1V (typ) (refer to the Electrical Characteristics section), 
BIOZ_CGMAG is 8 to 96 x 10^-6A, 
BIOZ_GAIN is 10V/V, 20V/V, 40V/V, or 80V/V. BIOZ_CGMAG and BIOZ_GAIN are set in CNFG_BIOZ (0x18).




Accelerometer: LIS2DW12
16 bit output, three axis
14 bit resolution for most power modes 
12 bit resolution for lowest power mode (low power mode 1)

32 slot FIFO
5 modes:
Bypass - One output at a time
FIFO - Stops collecting when buffer is full
Continuous - Data moves between all 32 slots before being discarded - buffer always full of most recent
Continuous to FIFO - Continuous until a trigger (example: free fall)
Bypass to continuous - Bypass until a trigger

Output registers:
OUT_X_L
OUT_X_H
OUT_Y_L
OUT_Y_H
OUT_Z_L
OUT_Z_H
Each is 8 bits. Combined into 3 16 bit values.

Free Fall Detection?



Temperature: MAX30210
FIFO contains up to 64, 2-byte temperature readings from a 16-bit ADC measurement
To calculate the temperature from the measurement result, convert the two’s complement value to the decimal value and 
use the following equation. 
T = Decimal Value × 0.005
